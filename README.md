## Getting Started 

### Check your version of python
in your terminal run the following commands to check your version of python:
`python -V`
If the above fails, try:
`python3 -V`
Or, if the "py" command is available, try:
`py -V`

Then `cd` (change directory) to the `src` which contains our source code.

If Python version returned in the previous command is 3.X:
Run `python3 -m http.server`. -- if on Windows, try `python -m http.server` or `py -3 -m http.server`

If Python version returned above is 2.X
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

By default, this will run the contents of the directory on a local web server, on port 8000. You can go to this server by going to the URL `localhost:8000` in your web browser. Here you'll see the contents of the directory listed â€” click the HTML file you want to run.

## Whats next?
Feel free to write all the HTML you want in the `src/index.html` and all the CSS you can think of in `src/styles.css`

After updating the source code refresh your browser to see the changes

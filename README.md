## Running the app

### Check your version of python
in your terminal run the following commands to check your version of python:
`python -V`
If the above fails, try:
`python3 -V`
Or, if the "py" command is available, try:
`py -V`

If Python version returned above is 3.X
On Windows, try `python -m http.server` or `py -3 -m http.server`
`python3 -m http.server`

 If Python version returned above is 2.X
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`


By default, this will run the contents of the directory on a local web server, on port 8000. You can go to this server by going to the URL `localhost:8000` in your web browser. Here you'll see the contents of the directory listed â€” click the HTML file you want to run.
